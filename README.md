# Stride

Stride is a mobile app for iOS designed to track running/walking with various community features to encourage the UCI community to be more active.


## What it does

Stride is a mobile app for iOS designed around being a simple yet effective way to track walks using geolocation and geospatial services. The home page gives users their daily steps and progress goals. The map page is an interactive map that follows your path and draws it out for users in real-time, along with tracking distance ran, calories burned, and current pace. The leaderboard allows users to compete with friends and see how well they are doing to encourage users to friendly competition. Challenges for bonus rewards can be placed around campus whenever there is a UCI/sport/community event, in order to encourage even more on-campus engagement. There is also a profile page to update settings and manage the account. Users are asked to login/create an account when first using the app.
